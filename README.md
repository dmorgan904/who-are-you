# Personal Portfolio

## Description
This is my Weekly Challenge #2 for my Coding Boot Camp class. Requirements included a photo, About Me section, Work section, and Contact Info. Certain links were to be made clickable such as those in the header navigation and images. When an image is clicked on, it leads to delpoyed applications. The portfolio must also be repsonsive and adaptable for different screen sizes.
